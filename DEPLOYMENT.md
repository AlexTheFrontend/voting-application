# Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] Git repository with proper branching strategy
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Vercel/hosting platform account set up
- [ ] Sentry account for error monitoring (optional)

### Pre-Deployment Steps

#### 1. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Configure required variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

#### 2. Code Quality Verification
```bash
# Run all checks locally before deploying
npm run type-check  # TypeScript compilation
npm run lint        # ESLint checks
npm run test        # Unit tests
npm run test:coverage # Coverage check (>80% required)
npm run build       # Production build
```

#### 3. Performance Audit
```bash

# Verify Core Web Vitals targets:
# FCP < 1.5s, LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
```

### Deployment Process

#### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Push to staging branch** â†’ Deploys to staging environment
2. **Create PR to main** â†’ Runs full CI/CD pipeline
3. **Merge to main** â†’ Deploys to production

#### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy to Vercel
npm run build
npx vercel --prod

# Or deploy to other platforms
npm run build
# Upload .next/ folder to your hosting service
```

### Environment-Specific Configurations

#### Staging Environment
- Branch: `develop`
- URL: `https://staging-your-app.vercel.app`
- Monitoring: Reduced sampling rates
- Features: All features enabled for testing

#### Production Environment
- Branch: `main`
- URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
- Monitoring: Full error tracking and analytics
- Features: Stable features only

### Required Secrets Configuration

#### GitHub Secrets
```
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
VERCEL_ORG_ID=your_vercel_org_id
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=your_vercel_project_id
```

#### Vercel Environment Variables
```
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ERROR_REPORTING=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

#### 1. Health Check
- [ ] Application loads successfully
- [ ] All forms work correctly
- [ ] API endpoints respond properly
- [ ] No console errors

#### 2. Performance Check
- [ ] Core Web Vitals in green
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Mobile experience optimized

#### 3. Monitoring Verification
- [ ] Sentry receiving error reports
- [ ] Analytics tracking page views
- [ ] Performance metrics being recorded
- [ ] Security headers active

### Rollback Procedure
If issues are detected post-deployment:

```bash
# Quick rollback via Vercel
vercel rollback [deployment-url]

# Or revert Git commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Monitoring & Alerting

#### Error Tracking (Sentry)
- Real-time error notifications
- Performance monitoring
- Release tracking
- User feedback collection

#### Performance Monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Custom metrics collection
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- API response time monitoring

#### Security Monitoring
- CSP violation reports
- Security headers verification
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated security audits

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Build Failures**
- Check TypeScript errors: `npm run type-check`
- Verify linting issues: `npm run lint`
- Check test failures: `npm run test`

**Performance Issues**
- Run bundle analyzer: `ANALYZE=true npm run build`
- Check Core Web Vitals in production
- Verify lazy loading is working

**Security Issues**
- Check CSP violations in browser console
- Verify security headers with online tools
- Run security audit: `npm audit`

#### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging:
```bash
DEBUG=* npm run build
NODE_ENV=development npm start
```

### Maintenance

#### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Weekly dependency updates
- [ ] Monthly security audits
- [ ] Quarterly performance reviews
- [ ] Ongoing monitoring of error rates

#### Update Process
1. Update dependencies in feature branch
2. Run full test suite
3. Deploy to staging for testing
4. Deploy to production during low-traffic hours
